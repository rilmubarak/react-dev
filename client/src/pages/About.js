                <p>Hello Everyone, This page is where the react.js lesson in Hacktiv8 is for displaying data from digimon 3th party API.
                    <br/> 
                    If the display has appeared, it is a sign that the lesson in this exercise has been passed. 
                    <br/>   
                    You can take a lesson from how I call digimon data both to display all the data and only based on the id. </p>
            </div>
        </>
    )
}
